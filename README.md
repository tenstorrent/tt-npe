**tt-npe** is a lightweight Network-on-Chip (NoC) Performance Estimator developed by Tenstorrent to simulate and analyze NoC workloads on Tensix-based devices. It supports profiling, visualization, and integration with tt-metal, enabling developers to optimize NoC communication performance through trace-driven or synthetic simulations. 

tt-npe supports wormhole_b0 and blackhole devices.

# What is this Repo? 
tt-npe simulates the behavior of an abstract NoC "workload" running on an simulated Tenstorrent device. A workload corresponds closely to a trace of all calls to the dataflow_api (i.e. `noc_async_read`, `noc_async_write`, ...). 

tt-npe can also act as a profiler/debugger for NoC traces, integrating with tt-metal profiler's device NoC trace capture feature and the ttnn-visualizer's new NPE mode. For more information, see the  [Profiler Mode](docs/src/getting_started.md#tt-npe-profiler-mode) section of the Getting Started page.

tt-npe can work with:
- Predefined workloads defined in files such as:
    - NoC trace JSON files extracted using tt-metal profiler's noc event capture feature
    - workload files with a simplified format more amenable to generation by other tools
- Programmatically constructed workloads using Python bindings
